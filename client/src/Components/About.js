                  Among all the forms of psychological and mental disorders, depression is the
                  most common form. Nowadays a large number of youths and adults around the
                  world suffer from depression. Depression can cause severe problems in case of
                  failing to detect at an early stage or failing to ensure the timely counseling of a
                  depressed person. It is one of the major reasons to raise suicidal cases. But
                  ironically, our society still does not want to acknowledge depression as a
                  mental disorder causing a significant number of depressed persons to remain
                  unidentified and untreated. Many psychiatrists found difficulties identifying
                  the existence of mental illness in a patient because of the complicated nature of
                  each mental disorder, thus making it hard to give the appropriate treatment to
                  the patient before it’s too late.<br/><br/>
                  However, the integration of social media into people’s daily life creates an
                  environment that may provide additional information regarding the mental
                  disorder a patient bears. This study has been undertaken as a Systematic
                  Literature Review (SLR), which is defined as a process of identifying,
                  assessing, and interpreting the available resources to provide answers to a set
                  of research questions.<br/><br/>
                  An analysis is made to answer questions regarding text-based mental illness
                  detection based on the social media activity of people with mental disorders
                  and reveals that it indeed is possible to do early detection of depression on
                  social media due to the existence of a particular characteristic in the way these
                  subjects use their social media. The analysis is also done based on different
                  characteristics, including age, gender, education, profession, marital status,
                  place of residence, and many other things that we will discuss in the "Proposed
                  System" section of the report
